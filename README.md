Purpose of our project
===============

Our project is a forum app which allows users to discuss with one another inside certain topics. It's purpose is to have an easy way for people to communicate accross the internet on topics which a user is interested in.



How to run our project
==============

Open the project in adnroid studio and sync with the gradle build. After that you should be able to run the app on a fresh emulator. You are not provided with login details. It is up to you to fill out the registration form. The data does not have to be valid, i.e the email can be fake. The registration form follows the standards of most forms, i.e 8 character password, and no whitespace usernames, etc. Although if for whatever reason you cannot register, we have default login details as:
user: kurt
pass: kurt123

To run the tests:
We have regular JUNIT tests located in the test folder with its corresponding AllTests and AllIntegration test files. 
We also have instrumented tests for our acceptance tests in espresso and our HTTP utils tests. These can be found under the androidTest folder with its corresponding AllHTTPTest and AllAcceptance test files.
