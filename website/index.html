	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">The forum will be used for taking part in discussions, sharing opinions, and responding to other users. Forum categories will be created to allow for the partitioning of discussions to ensure people looking for specific topics are able to easily find posts related to that topic. Users will have the ability to create these topics for people to post related discussions in, as well as to partake/view discussions in this topic.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">The forum can display discussions within a topic which the users can choose to read or partake in. The user will also have the ability to start a discussion. Users will have the ability to share an image or a poll along with a discussion. Users can like/dislike any discussion and/or comments, as well as see how many likes/dislikes a discussion/comment has. Users will have the ability to create a discussion but not edit the discussion once it is created.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Each user will have the ability to create a profile to start viewing, creating or participating in posts. Users will have a unique username and a short bio they can write for themselves as well as the ability to upload a profile picture. Users will have the ability to follow certain topics as well as favorite/save discussions they like. Users will be able to partake in the polls other people start and also view the results of that poll.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Forums are a place where anyone can come to see other peoples views and opinions, as well as state their own. That being said, the user base is not expected to be targeted to a specific group of people, rather the topics are made to guide specific groups into spaces of people who want to talk about similar things. For example someone who wants to talk about video games may mainly be in the “Gaming” topic, while someone who enjoys cooking may mainly be in the “Cooking” topic while both are still using the same app. Thus the only real constraints on the audience we will want to cater to are those who enjoy being on the internet, likely ranging from teenagers to middle-aged adults.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">In pre-release versions of our forum we’ll create sample user accounts and posts to make sure everything is working properly. Once we finalize and release our build, everything including accounts, topics, discussions, and comments will be generated by real users who use the system, not just test accounts and posts made by devs.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">The forum will start off as an Android application but has the basis and framework to be extended into other forms of consumption and usage such as a web page or desktop application. Since the forum provides a public API other users are also free to create their own applications or plug-ins using the API to connect to our back end.</p>

			<h2>Target User Group</h2>
		</div>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">For our system, we intend for anybody to use it. Anybody who has an interest in something will likely want to use our app as they can discuss their interest with others who feel the same way. Generally people enjoy talking to one another, and this app allows for an easy and simplified way of doing that with anybody across the globe.</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">The first piece of major functionality the user will see when they open the app is the login page. Here users will be asked to either create an account or login with an existing one. They can choose a username and set a password to login. This allows each user to have separate accounts to help distinguish themselves from others.</p>
			<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Once the user has logged in, they’ll be greeted by the topics page. Here the user can create a new topic to house discussions generally relating to that topic. Users can click any of the currently created topics to see the discussions inside. From here, users can then decide if they want to contribute to the topic by creating a discussion of their own, or simply continue browsing what others have to say. Clicking on any of the discussions will bring the user to a new view about the discussion. These discussions not only show the content that the user wrote, but also when and who created it. It also displays a list of comments others have written about that discussion. Similar to discussions, these comments store who created it, when, and the content of the comment. Users can also choose to create new comments in this view as well.</p>

				<p>Working with a team has taught me a lot. I have learned how to manage large projects and partition work amongst team members a lot better. Estimating the scope and scale of a feature/bug/task has been a major improvement for me. As a bonus I have learned more about developing android apps and how to apply software design principles to real world projects.</p>

				<p>First thing that i have learned is that if I found a problem, it is important to tell the group early so that the group can solve the problem early. Inaddition,it is my first time to use git command, I was realized keep the repository origanized is important, otherwise it would be painful.</p>

				<p>Throughout the project I learned how to work on a large group project efficiently. In the beginning I didn’t know anything about working as a team in a programming setting and I simply worked without planning it out with my group beforehand. Now I realized how important it is to discuss everything with your group members.</p>

				<p>Most important skill I got would be teamwork. Learned about Git and android development which is an essential technical skill that's gonna help me a lot for my future software development. Also even just communicating with teammates taught me a lot of important stuff which is gonna be really helpful in future.</p>

			<h2>Postmortem</h2>
		</div>
		<h3>What went right in the development process?</h3>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Once we were a little bit in our development process, we began to get a lot more comfortable talking to each other. There used to be times where our team wouldn’t talk to each other much which proved to be a big mistake as we were often confused with what each of us had to do. As we began to get closer, we felt comfortable sharing things we struggled with and began asking for more help from others. This leads to not only faster development, but also higher quality work as someone with more experience in similar issues could work through it.</p>
		<h3>What went wrong in the development process?</h3>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Although our communication got better, we could not find a way to safely merge all of our work as a team. There would often be major conflicts when trying to merge branches because we weren’t communicating with each other when and if it was okay to merge a specific branch at a certain time. For example, Someone would finish their work in a branch and push to development. Right afterward, someone else would try to merge their completed work with development, but that second person wouldn’t know that development was just updated and that they needed to pull to update their code. This proved to be a major issue in iteration 2, however we were able to better our communication when merging in iteration 3</p>
		<h3>Improvement from Iteration 2</h3>
		<p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">After iteration 2 we wanted to improve our login experience as it was very lacking at the time. We were able to fully implement a working login system, even storing account information in our remote database. It now works exactly how we want it to and reflects a real world account system. By splitting this task into smaller pieces we were able to comfortably implement this feature as before it seemed like a nightmare to try and implement something like it. We’re very happy with how it turned out and are presently surprised with how well it integrated with our remote database.</p>

		</div>
		<br><p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Above you’ll see our velocities for each iteration we’ve completed. Notice that the first iteration has a very low amount of days worked as most of our time was spent getting used to Android Studio. In the second iteration we began to kick into second gear as the amount of days worked drastically rose. You’ll notice that in the second iteration the estimated time and time actually spent are quite far apart from one another. We struggled to estimate our tasks well and overall it ended up taking more time than we thought it would. The third iteration demonstrates how well we improved our estimates as you’ll notice how close the time estimated is to the amount of time actually spent.</p>
